# WordCount
For this project, I wrote a code in python to get the data from text and build a table TermIndex in SQL server. The first phase of the code shows how to connect to database with python, I used pyodbc to connect to data base company through driver ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server and server A. The next phase, the code counts the number of repetitions of each word and put in in new dictionary and next word-dic-wo-stop is to delete stop words. I used nltk library to use stopwords and delete them from the dictionary of my words. At the end, code creates the table "TermIndex and send it to SQL database company.
